# GardenPlanner

Welcome to your new the Garden Planner CLI!  This CLI gives you a list of viable plants for an outdoor garden in the location of your choice that you can then plant in your own 8 planting spaces (you can add many of the same or different vegetables to your own garden).  Each plant contains a bio and more planting information to help your garden be a success!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'garden_planner'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install garden_planner

## Usage

To run the CLI, enter ./garden_planner after entering into to the bin folder.  Follow the prompts and press "C" to exit.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
